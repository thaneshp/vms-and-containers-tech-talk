# Containers and VMs: Why do they exist?

On the 3rd of August 2021, I gave a talk at [Dev(){CoP} Melbourne](https://www.devcop.io/) discussing Containers and Virtual Machines. The purpose of this talk was to provide insight into the specific problems these technologies aim to solve.

The slides are available here:
